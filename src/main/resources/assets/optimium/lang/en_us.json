  "optimium.options.use_block_face_culling.name": "Use Block Face Culling",
  "optimium.options.use_block_face_culling.tooltip": "If enabled, only the sides of blocks which are facing the camera will be submitted for rendering. This can eliminate a large number of block faces very early in the rendering process, saving memory bandwidth and time on the GPU. Some resource packs may have issues with this option, so try disabling it if you're seeing holes in blocks.",
  "optimium.options.use_fog_occlusion.name": "Use Fog Occlusion",
  "optimium.options.use_fog_occlusion.tooltip": "If enabled, chunks which are determined to be fully hidden by fog effects will not be rendered, helping to improve performance. The improvement can be more dramatic when fog effects are heavier (such as while underwater), but it may cause undesirable visual artifacts between the sky and fog in some scenarios.",
  "optimium.options.use_entity_culling.name": "Use Entity Culling",
  "optimium.options.use_entity_culling.tooltip": "If enabled, entities determined not to be in any visible chunks will be skipped during rendering. This can help improve performance by avoiding the rendering of entities located underground or behind walls. No real reason to disable.",
  "optimium.options.use_particle_culling.name": "Use Particle Culling",
  "optimium.options.use_particle_culling.tooltip": "If enabled, only particles which are determined to be visible will be rendered. This can provide a significant improvement to frame rates when many particles are nearby.",

  "optimium.options.allow_direct_memory_access.name": "Allow Direct Memory Access",
  "optimium.options.allow_direct_memory_access.tooltip": "If enabled, some critical code paths will be allowed to use direct memory access for performance.

  "optimium.options.use_model_instancing.name": "Use VBOs",
  "optimium.options.use_model_instancing.tooltip": "If enabled, supported models will be packed into VBOs and instanced.

This can drastically improve framerates when many entities are visible.",
  "optimium.options.enable_api_debug.name": "Enable API Debug",
  "optimium.options.enable_api_debug.tooltip": "If enabled, the graphics API will be placed into debug mode, which will produce more detailed and useful logs for developers. This may have some overhead when enabled, so disable it unless necessary.",
